SDLC 

Stages:
Requirement Gathering --> Planning --> Designing --> Development --> Testing --> Deployment --> Maintence

Models:
Waterfall
Agile
Prototype etc

In Agile model --> Whole project will be divided into sprints and development will be made a partially developed product at each sprint

Problem with frequent deployments:
Developer will be frequently deploying the codes, where OPS don't have clear instructions on how to deploy the code causes late deployment

Here to resolve the issue:
DEVOPS --> Developer + Operations team integrates and work to resolve the conflicts and ensures faster delivery.

Stages in Devops:
1. Developer commit the code 
2. Code Test
3. Code Analysis
4. build the code
5. Deployment of Software
6. OPS Changes
7. Software Testing
8. Go Live
9. UAT
10. Maintenance

DevOPS could be achieved and comprises CI and CD
CI: Continous Integration
CD: Continous Delivery

CI:
Problem: If code has been developed for 3 weeks without built without frequent built, and if errors occurs, then it will be very diffcult to identify and go back to sit and work.
Goal: CI ensures to identify the build issues at the early stages 
Cycle: Code --> Fetch --> Test --> Build --> Notify
Tools:
Various IDE's,
build could be jar, war, exe, dll etc
Includes stages of devops: 1, 2, 3, 4,5

CD:
Problem: There are high chances are deployment may fail because of various reasons, could be ops related
Goal: CD ensures to identify the challenges to deploy at the early stages
It includes server provisioning like networking, resource scaling, firewall changes etc
Tools:
Servers
Databases
etc
includes stages of devops: 6, 7, 8
