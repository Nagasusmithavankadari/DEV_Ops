Virtualization:
It allows one computer to run multiple OS
you will be parting physical machine resource in virtual resource
It allows isolation of environment
each vm will have its own os

2 types of hypervisor:
1. bare metal :runs as base os, meaning for every os you setup, each os will have hyper visor, used for prod, ex: VMware esxi
2. runs as software: host os wont have hypervisor, only guest os will have hyper visors, used for test and learn ex: oracle virtual box

Oracle VM Issues:
To install VM:
1. Time Consuming
2. So Many steps to install
3. Human Error chances will be there
4. Difficult to replica on many VM's
5. Need to document very step

all those above issues will be resolved by vagrants

Vagrants
1. No OS installation is needed
free box will be available on vagrant cloud

2. Vagrant File[its like a text file] :
Manage all vm settings in a file
vm changes through vagrant file
provisioning is faster 

3. Simple commands:
vagrant init boxname
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
Incase of multiple vagrants: vagrant ssh <vm_name>
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
vagrant status
vagrant list
varant box list --> To list the vagrant boxes
To show vagrant statuses at global: vagrant global-status
To prune: vagrant global-status prune

When ever vagrant is created,
guest system will be mapped with /vagrant volume [could be some other as well] 
--> you will get to know when we run vagrant up command --> you could see this data in vagrant file as well
# config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data" --> /data --> host machine volume group has been mappedw
with guest machine[vm] /vagrant_data folder

Vagrant provisioning: which means, executing the commands immediately after booting.
