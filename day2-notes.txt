Virtualization:
It allows one computer to run multiple OS
you will be parting physical machine resource in virtual resource
It allows isolation of environment
each vm will have its own os

2 types of hypervisor:
1. bare metal :runs as base os, meaning for every os you setup, each os will have hyper visor, used for prod, ex: VMware esxi
2. runs as software: host os wont have hypervisor, only guest os will have hyper visors, used for test and learn ex: oracle virtual box

Oracle VM Issues:
To install VM:
1. Time Consuming
2. So Many steps to install
3. Human Error chances will be there
4. Difficult to replica on many VM's
5. Need to document very step

all those above issues will be resolved by vagrants

Vagrants
1. No OS installation is needed
free box will be available on vagrant cloud

2. Vagrant File[its like a text file] :
Manage all vm settings in a file
vm changes through vagrant file
provisioning is faster 

3. Simple commands:
vagrant init boxname
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
vagrant status
vagrant list
